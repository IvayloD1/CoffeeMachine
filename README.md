<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="5" data-line-end="13">Write a program that will work endlessly to make coffee for all interested persons until the shutdown signal is given.<br>
If the user types “buy”, “fill” or “take”, then just do what the program did in the previous step. However, if the user wants to switch off the coffee machine, he should type “exit”. Then the program should terminate. Also, when the user types “remaining”, the program should output all the resources that the coffee machine has.<br>
If the coffee machine doesn’t have enough resources to make coffee, the program should output a message that says it can’t make a cup of coffee.<br>
In case  the user types “buy” to buy a cup of coffee and then changes his mind, he should be able to type “back” to return into the main cycle.<br>
